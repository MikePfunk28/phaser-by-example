        @Map4GameScene4.js@GameScene4.js Everyone of these files I listed fix the transition to what it was,
        @SceneTransition.js
        SceneTransition.to, unless there is an easier way. However, @SceneOrderManager.js only manages the
        sortselectionscene.
        SceneTrainsition.js has the scenes listed how I want them to appear. Lastly @SortSelectionScene.js uses images,
        yes I
        did make a config for what is a map, and I should use the @background.png image on that, maybe even the aws
        logo, but
        then the thumbnails are images not scenes, @map-config64.json is the config for that scene</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>can you help me to make the 16 scenes in this which all have the same code but use different questions, icon
        images(which are aws icons or pngs), map images, config files, but all do the same thing, you answer 5 questions, and
        then transition to the space invader mini game, from there to the next scene.
        
        For example:
        bootscene goes to mainmenu, from there I can select sort selection, or space invader, continue, and new game. New game
        brings me to map1scene1, after I answer all 5 questions, it brings me to space_invaders, after I die in space invaders,
        map1scene2, then I answer 5 different questions, obviously, and then to space_invaders. And if I got all 5 questions
        correct in one scene, I get a bonus, one of the 16 bonuses for 16 scenes. The bonus or powerup manager handles that, but
        there are two power ups, in game which are temporary and ones you get from the trivia, and answer all 5 correct in that
        scene. which last for the game, until you complete all maps, 4 maps 4 scene 16 scenes. SO we should be able to have a
        @main.js @SceneTransition.js and a triviamasterscene, plus a basegamescene, which I doubt wee ned all of these but as
        long as it works for all scenes, should this be that easy</p>
